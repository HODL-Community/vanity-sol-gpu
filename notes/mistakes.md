# Agent Mistakes Log

## 2026-02-12

- Mistake: I created the worktree at `vanity-eth-gpu/vanity-eth-gpu-contract` instead of a sibling path because I used a repo-relative path from inside the repo root.
- Avoid: When adding a worktree, run `git worktree add ../<name> -b codex/<branch>` and verify with `git worktree list` immediately.
- Cleanup: If the nested worktree is not desired, remove it with `git worktree remove vanity-eth-gpu-contract` from the main repo root.

- Mistake: I used backticks directly inside a double-quoted `gh pr create --body "..."` shell string, which triggered command substitution (`command not found`) and produced a malformed PR body.
- Avoid: Use a single-quoted heredoc (`cat <<'EOF'`) or escape backticks when passing markdown through shell flags.
- Cleanup: Immediately correct the PR description with `gh pr edit --body-file <file>`.

- Mistake: I interpreted “remove EIP-55” as removing the feature instead of removing the wording in the selector, and merged that broader behavior change.
- Avoid: Confirm scope by mapping the request to explicit targets (label text vs runtime logic) before editing behavior paths.
- Cleanup: Restore the previous behavior and apply only the requested copy change in a follow-up PR.

- Mistake: I tried to remove files using `rm -rf` in this environment, and the command was blocked by policy.
- Avoid: Prefer `apply_patch` delete hunks for tracked-file removals so cleanup is tool-policy compatible.
- Cleanup: Re-run the file removals via `apply_patch` and verify deletions with `git status --short`.

- Mistake: I imported `@noble/curves/ed25519` without the `.js` extension, which failed TypeScript module resolution under the repo’s ESM/bundler settings.
- Avoid: For `@noble/*` subpath imports in this setup, use explicit `.js` subpath imports from the start and run a build after dependency swaps.
- Cleanup: Replace imports with `@noble/curves/ed25519.js` and rerun `npm run build` to confirm.

- Mistake: I assumed typed-array buffers would satisfy `ArrayBuffer` transfer typings, but under strict TS they were inferred as `ArrayBufferLike`, causing compile errors in worker postMessage and `queue.writeBuffer`.
- Avoid: Validate transfer/buffer boundaries early for worker/GPU code; normalize with explicit `Uint8Array#slice()` copies when strict buffer types are required.
- Cleanup: Send typed arrays directly through worker messages (or copy into concrete `ArrayBuffer`), and pass a concrete copy into `queue.writeBuffer` before building.
